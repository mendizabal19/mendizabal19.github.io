            Elkar app was created to improve the app of this shop that it is available to download in the market.<p>
            Elkar is a Spanish bookshop where you can buy several things like books, videogames, backpacks, calendars and scholar material. <p>
            The redesign of this app was decided when I saw the nowadays app. You only can buy books, CDs and read the books that you have bought. For that reason we make a redesign for all the users who want to buy other items that are not books or CDs. With the new app make a purchase is very quickly and simple.<p>
            The colors I have use for the app are the color from the logo. I want to maintain the logo and the colors because they are strong enough

            Poster about poverty

                The next poster that you can see is about poverty. The idea of it is attract attention of the users letting them know that in rich countries like Spain we have many resources but we also waste most of it and in other poor countries like Africa they have very few resources.  That the reason why I put Europe like a plant that always have water (the water are the resources) and Africa below the pot taking the leftovers of water.
